ðŸ’¼ Contribution â€“ Smart Gujarat Hackathon 2025
Role: Front-End Developer

Overview:
As part of a multidisciplinary team, I contributed to the development of our web-based solution for the Smart Gujarat Hackathon 2025. My primary focus was on designing and implementing the Homepage and Gallery sections of the application.

Key Contributions:

Designed and developed a fully responsive Homepage with a clean, user-centric layout to ensure intuitive navigation and accessibility.
Built the Gallery section to dynamically showcase project-related images and media, incorporating interactive elements for an enhanced user experience.
Collaborated closely with team members to align the visual design with the projectâ€™s objectives and overall functionality.
Note: While only the Homepage and Gallery were fully functional in the final submission, these components demonstrated our core concept effectively and laid a strong foundation for future development.
